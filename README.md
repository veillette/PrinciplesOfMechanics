# Principles of Mechanics

This repository contains a MyST Markdown edition of *Principles of
Mechanics: Fundamental University Physics* by Salma Alrasheed. The MyST book
is the primary edition maintained here: its configuration, chapters,
bibliography, and figure assets all live at the repository root.

The original book was published by Springer in 2019 and is available as an
open-access work at
[doi:10.1007/978-3-030-15195-9](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-15195-9).
This rendition preserves the book's prose, equations, figures, worked
examples, problems, and chapter structure in an accessible web-native format.

## Fidelity to the original text

This edition is the original book, not a revised textbook. We have made no
attempt to update, correct, or modernize the physics content. The goal here is
faithful conversion into MyST Markdown and web-native publication—not editorial
revision.

That means known inaccuracies and outdated statements from the 2019 Springer
edition remain exactly as published. For example, Chapter 1 still defines the
kilogram in terms of the historical platinum–iridium prototype cylinder, even
though the SI definition of mass has since changed. We are fully aware that
passage is now incorrect; we have deliberately left it unchanged.

If you use this book for teaching or study, treat it as a historical snapshot
of the published text. Do not assume the scientific definitions, constants, or
explanations have been brought up to date.

## Read and edit the MyST edition

The main entry points are:

- [`myst.yml`](myst.yml) — project metadata and table of contents
- [`index.md`](index.md) — book landing page
- [`chapters/`](chapters/) — the ten converted chapters
- [`images/`](images/) — EPUB-derived chapter figures
- [`references.bib`](references.bib) — bibliography data

## Build

```bash
npm install
npm run start          # preview
npm run build          # static site in _build/html/
```

Generated output is written to `_build/` and is not committed. CI runs on
pull requests (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`); pushes to `main` deploy via
[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## Legacy LaTeX edition

The earlier PDF-derived LaTeX conversion remains available under
[`latex/`](latex/). It is retained as a historical and cross-checking source,
but it is not the canonical edition and may contain extraction or OCR errors.
The EPUB XHTML and equation metadata were treated as authoritative during the
MyST conversion.

## Conversion materials

`outline.json` records the source mapping and expected content counts. Local
EPUB/PDF extracts and page renders live under the ignored `tmp/` and `work/`
directories and are not part of the published book.
